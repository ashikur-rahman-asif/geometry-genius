                <article>
                    Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.

                    What is a callback function and why will you use it?
                </h2>
                <article>
                    A callback function in javascript is a function that is passed as an argument in another function. Which is then called inside the parent function to complete a routine or an action. To put it more simply, it is a function that will be called(executed) later after its parent function(the function in which it is passed as an argument) is done executing
